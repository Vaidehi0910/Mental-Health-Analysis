# Mental-Health-Analysis

## Project requirements
 For the purpose of this project, all the currently available datasets have been used. The datasets currently available are from the years **2014, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019.**
The datasets need to be cleaned and combined to carry out any further analysis.  

#### The original datasets downloaded from OSMI are in the [***datasets***](./datasets) directory.  
#### The cleaned dataset is saved to the [***cleanedDatasets***](./cleanedDatasets) directory.

### Cleaning the dataset

The Jupyter Notebook ***DataCleanup*** deals with the process of cleaning and combining the datasets.

### Analysing the dataset

The Jupyter Notebook ***DataAnalysis*** deals with the process of analysing the dataset features and studying data trends.

### Supervised Machine Learning

The Jupyter Notebook ***SupervisedLearning*** shows some supervised machine learning models trained on the cleaned dataset.
